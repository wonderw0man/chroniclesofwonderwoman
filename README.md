> A Golden Moment: On India's win in Chess Olympiad.

~By~ winning the joint championship with RUSSIA in online chess olympiad held on Sunday ~beacuse~ of the 44th edition had to be postponed till next year due to the pandemic, INDIA proves that it is growing its stature in the world of chess.The victroy was shared because The Indian team management lodged a complaint, and the FIDE proposed its decision for sharing the championship on which Russia  agreed, beacuse the 2nd round of final was affected by a net outage, due to this India’s Nihal Sarin and Divya Deshmukh had lost on time. ~Thus~, there was a fruitful ending to the final. When Armenians raised similar complaint after the loss of game, to India in the first match of the quarter-final. They protested by not playing the second match and withdrew from the competition. But that incident should not take the sheen off India’s triumph. 
 
 ~If~ Viswanathan Anand and Koneru Humpy are among the greatest players the world has ever seen, Nihal and R. Praggnanandhaa could be tomorrow’s stars. In the euphoria surrounding the great Indian victory, some grim facts should not be overlooked. The Indian chess team pulled off a thrilling victory against Poland in the semifinal of the Olympiad when the Arjuna awards were being distributed by President Ram Nath Kovind online on Saturday. Ironically, no chess player has won an Arjuna for seven years. India captain Vidit Gujrathi had said how the team was on its own ahead of the Olympiad with no support from the All India Chess Federation. The chief selector R.B. Ramesh  quit because he was forced to announce two separate teams for the Olympiad. This moment of glory, therefore, is also a time for introspection.

> Grim Sovereign Tangle: On GST compensation standoff.

All of the profits gained by implmentation of GST have quickly unravelled because the slowdown in the economy, and worsen by COVID-19 lockdowns, has thrown all revenue calculations to the wind. The Centre is obliged to pay to the States, for a duration of 5 years, compensation for revenue shortfalls in return for their having ceded the strength to levy the a multiple of taxes that have been absorbed into the GST. Last week, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman asserted, that the Centre will not be able to meet the compensation shortfall. With GST collections sharply undershooting all targets this year, the Center estimates compensation payable for the full year at ₹3-lakh crore. But just ₹65,000 crore is expected in the cess kitty used to pay out the compensation.
 
In July, the Centre paid out the last instalment of fiscal for the economy and is, so far, yet to pay anything for this year. The Centre contends that only ₹97,000 crore of the revenue shortfall is from implementation of the GST, while ₹1.38-lakh crore is due to remarkable occasions posed by an ‘Act of God’(the pandemic). States can both borrow ₹97,000 crore, without having it added to their debt and with the principal and interest paid out from future cess collections, or they can borrow the entire ₹2.35-lakh crore shortfall, but will must offer for interest payments themselves. Several States have rejected both options and some, including Tamil Nadu, have urged the Center to rethink in view of their essential and urgent spending needs to curb the pandemic and spur growth.

> Loyalty test: On Congress and reform.

Far from living up to that claim, Rahul Gandhi led the coterie in questioning the timing and intent of the reformists who did little more than echo his own views about the party’s problems. No one, least of all well-wishers of the Congress party, would find it difficult to disagree with the issues raised by the party leaders such as the erosion of the party base, particularly among the youth, a drift caused by the absence of a full-time president, the dismantling of all forums for discussions in the party, concentration of power, and the disuse of the merit-cum-consensus method of appointments within the party. While the Congress is crumbling, the BJP is advancing its contentious agenda, these leaders pointed out. The notion of a conflict between loyalists and dissenters is being peddled by a gang of self-serving leaders to explain the churn in the Congress.

Those who may not play the obsequious roles conventionally scripted for a Congress leader are Mr. Gandhi’s greatest allies if he were to push for the party’s revival. It is possible that reformists also have a career agenda, but that is no sin in politics.

> Appropriate strategy: On India banning more China apps.

The blocking of a more than hundreds of Chinese mobile applications suggests that the Indian government, wants to make it clear that it will not shy away from leveraging its position as a massive market for technology in dealing with potentially dangerous geopolitical issues.
Since June, the government has till now stepped in thrice to block many Chinese applications in one go, including the latest decision on Wednesday where 118 apps were blocked in respect "prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of State and public order".  Over 200 Chinese apps, which were accessed by millions of Indian users, have been blocked in all till date.

It could be argued that loss of access to the Indian market will sharply affect the ambitions of the Internet giants emerging from China, but it remains to be seen if this tech-side intervention is effective as a counter in a geopolitical fight. Instead, the Indian response to complaints has been to straight away block these apps all together.
