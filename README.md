> A Golden Moment: On India's win in Chess Olympiad.
~By~ winning the joint championship with RUSSIA in online chess olympiad held on Sunday ~beacuse~ of the 44th edition had to be postponed till next year due to the pandemic, INDIA proves that it is growing its stature in the world of chess.The victroy was shared because The Indian team management lodged a complaint, and the FIDE proposed its decision for sharing the championship on which Russia  agreed, beacuse the 2nd round of final was affected by a net outage, due to this India’s Nihal Sarin and Divya Deshmukh had lost on time. ~Thus~, there was a fruitful ending to the final. When Armenians raised similar complaint after the loss of game, to India in the first match of the quarter-final. They protested by not playing the second match and withdrew from the competition. But that incident should not take the sheen off India’s triumph. 
 
 ~If~ Viswanathan Anand and Koneru Humpy are among the greatest players the world has ever seen, Nihal and R. Praggnanandhaa could be tomorrow’s stars. In the euphoria surrounding the great Indian victory, some grim facts should not be overlooked. The Indian chess team pulled off a thrilling victory against Poland in the semifinal of the Olympiad when the Arjuna awards were being distributed by President Ram Nath Kovind online on Saturday. Ironically, no chess player has won an Arjuna for seven years. India captain Vidit Gujrathi had said how the team was on its own ahead of the Olympiad with no support from the All India Chess Federation. The chief selector R.B. Ramesh  quit because he was forced to announce two separate teams for the Olympiad. This moment of glory, therefore, is also a time for introspection.

> Grim Sovereign Tangle: On GST compensation standoff.

All of the profits gained by implmentation of GST have quickly unravelled because the slowdown in the economy, and worsen by COVID-19 lockdowns, has thrown all revenue calculations to the wind. The Centre is obliged to pay to the States, for a duration of 5 years, compensation for revenue shortfalls in return for their having ceded the strength to levy the a multiple of taxes that have been absorbed into the GST. Last week, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman asserted, that the Centre will not be able to meet the compensation shortfall. With GST collections sharply undershooting all targets this year, the Center estimates compensation payable for the full year at ₹3-lakh crore. But just ₹65,000 crore is expected in the cess kitty used to pay out the compensation.
 
In July, the Centre paid out the last instalment of fiscal for the economy and is, so far, yet to pay anything for this year. The Centre contends that only ₹97,000 crore of the revenue shortfall is from implementation of the GST, while ₹1.38-lakh crore is due to remarkable occasions posed by an ‘Act of God’(the pandemic). States can both borrow ₹97,000 crore, without having it added to their debt and with the principal and interest paid out from future cess collections, or they can borrow the entire ₹2.35-lakh crore shortfall, but will must offer for interest payments themselves. Several States have rejected both options and some, including Tamil Nadu, have urged the Center to rethink in view of their essential and urgent spending needs to curb the pandemic and spur growth.

> Loyalty test: On Congress and reform.

Far from living up to that claim, Rahul Gandhi led the coterie in questioning the timing and intent of the reformists who did little more than echo his own views about the party’s problems. No one, least of all well-wishers of the Congress party, would find it difficult to disagree with the issues raised by the party leaders such as the erosion of the party base, particularly among the youth, a drift caused by the absence of a full-time president, the dismantling of all forums for discussions in the party, concentration of power, and the disuse of the merit-cum-consensus method of appointments within the party. While the Congress is crumbling, the BJP is advancing its contentious agenda, these leaders pointed out. The notion of a conflict between loyalists and dissenters is being peddled by a gang of self-serving leaders to explain the churn in the Congress.

Those who may not play the obsequious roles conventionally scripted for a Congress leader are Mr. Gandhi’s greatest allies if he were to push for the party’s revival. It is possible that reformists also have a career agenda, but that is no sin in politics.

***THE HINDU EDITORIALS*** 🧐

> Appropriate strategy: On India banning more China apps.

The blocking of a more than hundreds of Chinese mobile applications suggests that the Indian government, wants to make it clear that it will not shy away from leveraging its position as a massive market for technology in dealing with potentially dangerous geopolitical issues.
Since June, the government has till now stepped in thrice to block many Chinese applications in one go, including the latest decision on Wednesday where 118 apps were blocked in respect "prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of State and public order".  Over 200 Chinese apps, which were accessed by millions of Indian users, have been blocked in all till date.

It could be argued that loss of access to the Indian market will sharply affect the ambitions of the Internet giants emerging from China, but it remains to be seen if this tech-side intervention is effective as a counter in a geopolitical fight. Instead, the Indian response to complaints has been to straight away block these apps all together.

> The right keys: On Unlock 4.

The Unlock 4 guidelines of the Home Ministry allowing all but a few activities that attract large crowds, with supportive measures by States, reflect deep economic distress. This comes at a time when daily infections are scaling new highs — 78,512 on Monday — and growing at a rate faster than in the U.S. and Brazil, which have held the top spots globally. When the pandemic was unfolding, a major concern was that of a wildfire spread overwhelming a lopsided health-care system, in which intensive care is meager, urban-centric and expensive even for the middle class. This painful reality, of the virus retaining high transmissible and unpredictable disease impacts, is as relevant today as it was then, as people resume their jobs and travel.

***THE HINDU EDITORIALS*** 🧐

> Deal in danger: On post-Brexit U.K.-EU trade deal.

The agreement had sought to avoid a hard border coming up between Northern Ireland, which is part of the U. The hard Brexiteers in Mr. Johnson’s Conservative Party were critical of this clause, claiming that it endangers the U. laws rather than the divorce agreement. Northern Ireland leaders have already called it a «betrayal». The real risk of cutting the region off the EU customs code is that physical checks could emerge between the two Irelands, threatening the Good Friday agreement that brought peace. With weeks to go before the deadline, there is still no consensus on issues such as workers’ rights, environmental regulations, state aid to businesses and the Irish border.

to adopt rules that are close to its own to ensure a «level playing field» in trade, the British government argues that the whole point of the EU divorce was to break free from common rules. Regarding Northern Ireland, the hard Brexiteers are opposed to any special treatment to the region. The new legislation suggests that the government is hardening its position on Ireland as well. Driven by English nationalist fervour, the British leadership appears to be blind to the economic and political consequences of its hard line.

The Brexiteers have already pushed the U. A no-deal exit will inflict severe economic costs on the British, at a time when the economy is in dire straits due to COVID-19. Besides, it risks disrupting peace in the island of Ireland. They should instead respect the withdrawal agreement, and be flexible in the talks as well as on deadlines.

### SUMMARY

***THE HINDU EDITORIALS*** 🧐

Test by choice: On rising coronavirus cases in India.

> On September 4, India crossed four million novel coronavirus cases, 13 days after crossing three million on August 22. On Sunday, India surpassed Brazil to record the second highest number of cases in the world. Though the number of tests done each day has been over one million for the past week, the test positivity rate nationally is still high at 7.7%, indicating that testing has to be ramped up. Though the testing done each day by many States has been growing, nearly 50% of them are rapid antigen, of only about 50-60% sensitivity.

Unfortunately, with no repeat testing of negative cases and only a small percentage of people with symptoms but negative results being validated with a RT-PCR, many of the infected are not being diagnosed. The ICMR’s latest advisory provides for testing on demand to «ensure higher levels of testing». With States not validating the negative results from rapid antigen tests with RT-PCR, non-directed tests on demand might help more in increasing the number of tests done each day and hence in reducing the test positivity rate than in early detection and containment. Since many of those infected have mild or no symptoms, tests on demand might be particularly helpful in detecting cases that might otherwise have been missed.

Else, States might be forced to use their discretionary power to deny tests for people not exhibiting symptoms or in low-risk categories, or selectively charge for testing to pay for procurement of testing kits and to avoid more pressure on the testing infrastructure. There is also the possibility of an over-reliance on antigen testing to cope with the growing demand for testing.

### SUMMARY

***THE HINDU EDITORIALS*** 🧐

Vaccine for all: On COVID-19 vaccine policy.

> In the initial stages, global health leaders have been advancing the vaccine for essential workers and those at risk including senior citizens and those with co-morbidities. Tedros said, «some people in all countries, rather than all people in some countries», should have access to the vaccine in the early phase. Even in this initial stage, the government should make the vaccine available free of cost to those who cannot pay, or at affordable rates. As production kicks off, initial production costs are likely to be high, even astronomical, and it is the duty of governments to cushion the cost.

Leaving gaps in the delivery of the vaccine will only serve to allow the virus to survive, and continue to wreak further damage. India has a fairly reliable vaccine delivery system for children, as part of the universal immunisation programme. All people in the country must have access to the vaccine, and, if necessary, periodic doses of it. Indeed, the mobilisation for this task in India should be nothing short of heroic, as and when the vaccine is available here.

This includes taking sensitive, but firm, decisions guided by evidence, on who will receive the vaccine, how, when and where. Putting down a standard operating protocol for every stage of the vaccine will serve the government well when the baton is finally passed on to it.

Digital disconnect: On online learning and digital divide.

> The digital chasm that separates the privileged from the deprived remains unbridged years after the broadband policy of 2004, and its effects are painfully evident during the pandemic as students struggle to log on to online classes. Only in Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala did the survey find Internet access exceeding 50% for urban and rural households taken together, while Punjab, Haryana and Uttarakhand exceeded 40%, unimpressive numbers still. If net connectivity is 5% to 10% in rural Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and West Bengal, only a slim minority can hope to do any academic work. Prime Minister Modi has acknowledged the digital divide by announcing in his Independence Day address that all villages would be connected with optical fibre cable in 1,000 days.

Mapping the needs of each district based on the NSO data will help identify areas where children do need equipment and connectivity. The government needs to look at all possibilities and go into overdrive to bridge the digital divide.

### SUMMARY

***THE HINDU EDITORIALS*** 🧐

> Something rotten: On Sushant Singh Rajput death and the media mob.

A young talented Bollywood actor tragically ended his life on June 14. But the events that followed Sushant Singh Rajput’s death by suicide have been even more shocking. A section of the media pounced on Rhea, terming her a gold digger, and handed out instant verdicts in the newsroom. That Sushant hailed from poll-bound Bihar added a political dimension impossible to ignore.

The actor, reported to have been suffering from depression, lived in Mumbai, which is now ruled by estranged Bharatiya Janata Party partner, the Shiv Sena, together with the Nationalist Congress Party and Congress, and his demise has become political fodder crossing limits of decency, drawing in other Bollywood celebrities.

Whether Rhea has committed a crime the law will decide, but as she and her family fight this battle, the spotlight is firmly on Indian society and its deeply entrenched prejudices. Women’s rights activists have spoken up against the demonisation of Rhea, and how gender, the clothes she wore, the undefined relationship she had with the actor, all played a role. What is perhaps more disturbing is that many women, far from empathizing with a girl who lost her boyfriend in such circumstances, have been quick to pronounce Rhea guilty of any number of wrongdoings.

> Glimmer of hope: On India-China five-point consensus.
India and China have taken the first step to begin real disengagement at the border

The "five-point consensus" reached by the Foreign Ministers of India and China in Moscow on Thursday provides a glimmer of hope of a diplomatic solution, while thousands of troops from both countries remain deployed along the border. At the same time, stark differences remain, including on the key question of whether both sides will return to the status quo ante prior to China’s transgressions. India stressed that peace on the boundary was essential for ties, and that recent incidents had impacted the broader relationship. This characterisation of India’s stand was a sharp contrast from Delhi’s recent public statements, which have emphasised border peace as a prerequisite to taking forward the broader relationship.

Moreover, a day before the talks, China’s official news agency issued a commentary placing the onus entirely on India to defuse tensions, accusing India of «reckless provocations», telling India «to learn from history», and reiterating that China «will not lose an inch of territory». It is welcome that India and China have finally found something to agree on. The continuing rounds of talks should be aimed sincerely at disengagement, and not at presenting a veneer of diplomatic engagement even while China strengthens its hold along the LAC. India will need to verify before it can trust each of China’s steps from now on.

### SUMMARY

***THE HINDU EDITORIALS*** 🧐
> Pushback: On U.S. revoking visa to Chinese students.
The Trump administration has revoked visas for more than 1,000 Chinese citizens, mainly students and researchers, deemed to be risks to national security owing to their alleged connections to Chinese military establishments and concern over industrial espionage. The White House’s latest policy action has been housed under Mr. Trump’s May 29 announcement responding to China’s curbs on democracy in Hong Kong. Among the reasons stated was the intention to block the entry of persons associated with slave labour, thought to be a reference to alleged rights violations of China’s Uighur Muslims. This visa policy comes after measures that have tightened the screws on the U. immigration system, including halting the issuance of green cards and skilled worker visas and challenging the issuance of student visas for college programmes that have migrated entirely to online mode due to the pandemic.

However, in the prior cases of visa issuance bans, the nationals of a single country were not targeted in the way that Chinese citizens have been under this week’s visa revocation. The deeper context of this spat is the cycle of hostile tit-for-tat exchanges between Washington and Beijing, principally tariff wars in the realm of trade, but extending to human rights and China’s COVID-19 response. On the one hand the Trump administration might have overreached in this broad-brush policy, perhaps sweeping up innocent researchers with no more than nominal association with a government-affiliated academic entity in China. Either way, China’s economic aggression will continue to face pushback from a wounded and angry America.

> Long haul ahead: On demand-supportive fiscal policies.
The most telltale sign of this flattening is the more than halved pace of growth in the solitary use-based industrial activity of the IIP’s six product groups, in which output had turned positive in June. The other five groups posted double-digit contractions, with consumer durables and capital goods shrinking 23.6% and 22.8%, respectively. If the trend in durables attests to the RBI’s evaluation last month that «private consumption has lost its discretionary elements across the board», the capital goods data point to a dismal picture on the investment front. A deeper look at the 23 subcategories of manufacturing shows that only tobacco products and pharmaceuticals posted expansions in July, with the latter benefitting from the increased global demand for medicines, including generic drugs, in the wake of the pandemic.

The manufacture of pharmaceuticals, medicinal chemical and botanical products climbed 22% in July, making it the solitary product to post an expansion of 1.8% over April-July.

### SUMMARY

***THE HINDU EDITORIALS*** 🧐
> More at the top: on US Open 2020.
The 2020 US Open, which concluded at New York on Sunday, may not have had its usual star dust, but that should not deflect from the excellence of Dominic Thiem and Naomi Osaka, who won their first and third Grand Slam singles titles, respectively. 1 Novak Djokovic, chasing Federer’s all-time record of 20 Grand Slams, took the bait, only to be disqualified in the fourth round for accidentally striking a line judge with the ball. Statistics aside, the tournament provided the first glimpse of how men’s tennis could shape up in the absence of Federer, Djokovic and Nadal. The Thiem-led mid-card, which also includes Zverev, Daniil Medvedev and Stefanos Tsitsipas, made good on its promise and provided three of the four semifinalists.

The most recent was in Melbourne early this year, where he came within a set of defeating Djokovic in the final after having already felled the then World No. The Japanese is the most decorated Asian singles player and her use of the platform of being the most marketable sportswoman on the planet to highlight instances of racial injustice has captured the world’s imagination. Serena, who failed yet again in her quest to capture a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam, will remain the top draw as long as she plays. But Osaka has carved out her own identity.

The immediate future of tennis may lie in a sequestered world of bio-secure bubbles, but barriers are no doubt being taken down.

> Venus in focus.
Earth's "sister planet" - Venus, the hottest planet in the solar system with surface temperature above 460 degree celcius, the planet was considered hostile to life.
Earlier there was a signs of ozone found by the European Space Agency in their mission Venus Express. Now in the recent discovery of traces of phosphine in its atmosphere has given a reason to search for extraterrestrial life. Through extraordinary chemistry and thermodynamics of the biology and life states the fact that when hostile conditions are added on Venus's surface, lure possiblities of phosphine's survival.

Prof. Jane S. Greaves of Cardiff University first identified phosphine in Venus's atmosphere in 2017, using the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope in Hawaii. The suspicions of research was confirmed in 2019, by further study and precise observations using the Atacama Large mm / sub-mm Array facility in Chile.

The presence of sulphuric acid in the atmoshphere of Venus makes it highly corrosive. Pherpas flying at a height and sending down the drones and ballons are more feasible than landing. NASA's mission is covered for launch next year, while ISRO is looking at 2023 rightnow.
Large number of collaborations may well improve chances of efficiently searching the dense atmosphere of the sister planet.

***THE HINDU EDITORIALS*** 🧐
> New order in West Asia: On Abraham Accords.
Under the agreement, the UAE and Bahrain would normalise ties with Israel, heralding better economic, political and security engagement. More Arab countries are expected to follow suit, say U. The agreements have the backing of Saudi Arabia, arguably the most influential Arab power and a close ally of the UAE and Bahrain. The ailing, octogenarian ruler of the Kingdom, Salman bin Abdulaziz, is treading cautiously for now, but Riyadh has opened its airspace for commercial flights between the UAE and Israel. The accords, the first between Israel and Arab countries since the 1994 Jordan-Israel peace treaty, also offer a rare diplomatic win to Mr. With less than 50 days to go before his re-election bid, he has called the agreements «the new dawn of a new Middle East».

Though of historical and geopolitical significance, it is too early to say whether the accords will have any meaningful impact on West Asia’s myriad conflicts. Unlike Egypt and Jordan, which signed peace treaties with Israel in 1979 and 1994, respectively, the Gulf countries are not frontline states in the Arab-Israeli conflict. Second, the agreements leave the Palestinian question largely unaddressed. With Arab countries signing diplomatic agreements with Israel bilaterally, the Arab collective support for the Palestinian movement for nationhood, which has been the basis of the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative, is crumbling.

But it does not mean that the Palestinian question would fade away. Three, the UAE-Bahrain agreements are in fact endorsing the region’s emerging order.

> Need for caution: On Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine.
The Russian Direct Investment Fund , which is piloting the Sputnik V vaccine, has announced a partnership with the Hyderabad-based Dr. Sputnik V is being developed as a two-dose vaccine on a human adenovirus vaccine platform. Several vaccines that are in development are also being deployed on similar platforms, and the evidence so far is that none of these has been commercially approved for use in humans though there is an experimental vaccine for Ebola. Results of the Phase-1 and Phase-2 trials of the vaccine, published in The Lancet, suggest that the evidence so far is that it has proven safe and efficacious enough to progress to the next stage of trials. There is immense political pressure globally on regulatory agencies to get a vaccine out at the earliest.

The Serum Institute has committed to producing 100 million doses of its vaccine for India and other ‘Low and Middle Income Countries’ at less than $3 per dose. Reportedly, half of these are for India. All in all, there seems to be a guarantee for only about 150 million doses for India, which given the country’s population is minuscule.

### SUMMARY

***THE HINDU EDITORIALS*** 🧐
> Continuity in change: On Japan’s new Prime Minister.
Less than a month after his sudden announcement that he would step down due to health reasons, Japan’s longest serving Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, 65, has passed on the baton to his long-term associate, Yoshihide Suga, 71. Suga promises continuity rather than change as he takes the reins. Suga was Minister of State for Internal Affairs and Communications during Mr. Suga said his goal is to continue with Mr. His close personal relationship with Mr. Modi, both seen as «strongmen» leaders, built on his earlier partnership with former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom he shared his famous «three arrows» economic strategy called ‘Abenomics’. Suga would be well aware of the big shoes he must fill and the importance of the relationship with India for Japan.

It is significant that one of the new government’s first engagements is likely to be the Foreign Minister-level meeting of the Quad countries in Tokyo next month, which will also give New Delhi insight into how much has changed and how much will stay the same in Japan’s view of the world with the change at the helm.

### SUMMARY

***THE HINDU EDITORIALS*** 🧐
> Market failure: On agriculture sector reforms.
Several States have already liberalized agricultural marketing, amending their APMC Acts, and some have allowed regulated private commerce including direct marketing. Yet, provisions in the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce Bill, 2020, providing for unfettered commerce in designated trade areas outside APMC jurisdictions without levy of any fee, and more generally, empowering the Centre to issue orders to States in furtherance of the law’s objectives, have alarmed States. A challenge has been mounted by Rajasthan, declaring central warehouses as procurement centres under its APMC Act, and therefore required to pay a market fee to the State. When Bihar removed the APMC system, markets suffered loss of fee revenue, with no significant private investments in the sector.

If the Centre’s intent is to strengthen competition, it should massively fund the expansion of the APMC market system, removing trade cartels, and providing farmers good roads, logistics of scale and real time information. Rather than opt for heavy centralisation, the emphasis should be on empowering farmers through State Farmers Commissions recommended by the NCF, to bring about a speedy government response to issues. Without strong institutional arrangements, laissez-faire policy may harm lakhs of unorganised small farmers, who have been remarkably productive and shored up the economy even during a pandemic.

### SUMMARY

***THE HINDU EDITORIALS*** 🧐
> Cricket in action: On IPL 2020.
The Twenty20 tournament seemingly brooked no resistance while the purists leant on the classical air that permeated Test cricket. Even in 2009 and 2014 when the Lok Sabha elections clashed with the IPL’s schedule, the Board of Control for Cricket in India solved the logistical nightmare. Because of the constraints imposed by the virus and the cancellation of domestic cricket in India for now, the IPL at the Emirates, has turned out to be the season opener for the national players while also offering an opportunity for overseas stars to have a biff in the park. The players have to watch their health-parameters while helping cricket find its feet, an endeavour that England did first with remarkable efficiency by hosting the West Indies, Pakistan and Australia.

Cricket in the Indian context has made a start and a lot is at stake as this IPL also offers a stage for Kohli and company to prepare for the coming tour of Australia.

### SUMMARY

***THE HINDU EDITORIALS*** 🧐
> A point of order: On farm bills.
Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman Harivansh’s refusal to conduct a division of votes on two controversial pieces of legislation on Sunday, despite persistent demands from members, was unprecedented in its sheer brazenness. The rules of procedure regarding voting are unambiguous that if a voice vote is challenged, «votes shall be taken by operating the automatic vote recorder or by the members going into the Lobbies». Even if a single member demands a division, it is required to be carried out. Quite often, a division of vote is demanded even when the outcome is predictable, in order to bring on record the positions of parties and members on a particular bill.

The explanation that members were not demanding a division from their seats and the House was not in order is disingenuous. To begin with, the disorder was triggered by the Chair’s refusal to order a division. Significant amendments were sought and several parties had demanded that they be referred to a parliamentary select committee. The flat out denial of a division of votes was a new low in parliamentary history.

Not stopping there, eight Opposition members were suspended for one week while notice for a no-confidence motion against the Deputy Chairman was rejected at the threshold by Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu.

### SUMMARY

***THE HINDU EDITORIALS*** 🧐
> A new world order: On UN reforms.
At a special session marking 75 years of the United Nations on Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for reform of its «outdated structures», pointing out that in the absence of comprehensive changes, the world body today faces a «crisis of confidence». India has been at the forefront of demanding reform in the UN, particularly its principal organ, the Security Council, for decades, staking its claim as one of the world’s largest economies and most populous countries, with a track record in promoting a rules-based international order, and contributing to peacekeeping through UN forces. The UN was born in the crisis of the World War era, and the realities of that time can hardly be compared to the present. The UNSC does not include a permanent member from the African, Australian and South American continents, and the pillars of the multilateral order, such as the G-4 group of Brazil, India, Germany and Japan, have been ignored for long.

Frequent divisions within the UNSC P-5 end up blocking key decisions.

### SUMMARY

***THE HINDU EDITORIALS*** 🧐
> A light touch: On regulation of digital media
The government has twice signaled in recent days that more rules are out of the question for dealing with illegal content and misinformation causing harm in the digital media space. In a statement filed in the Sudarshan TV case on Monday, in response to a Supreme Court call for proposals to improve the self-regulatory mechanism for electronic media, the center said regulating web-based digital media was a must instead. Without any controls, according to the Court of Justice, digital media can spread "toxic hatred", terror and violence. In recent years, there have been many lifetimes of such violence driven by misinformation in India.

These issues are all the more important given that in recent years there has been a wave of investment in the digital news media space. A large number of these media sites and magazines seek legitimate journalistic initiatives that not only have appropriate quality assurance mechanisms, but also operate with a high degree of accountability.

> Terms of disengagement: On India-China standoff.
stressing that many questions remain unanswered. While this deal has the potential to help stem the bleeding so to speak,

The joint press release makes no mention of restoring the status quo ante from April, only referring to any unilateral change in the situation on the ground, which refers to the current status quo. At the same time, a second joint public statement in as many weeks is a positive development in itself, showing that the two intend to stabilize the situation, even though their motives may be different. For the Indian government, such a statement in the middle of a parliamentary session where it was faced with questions about its handling of the LAC situation sends the message that the Chinese crisis is under control.

### SUMMARY

***THE HINDU EDITORIALS*** 🧐
> Code debate: On new labour Bills.
The three codes aimed at consolidating various labor laws and initiating reforms fall into this category. The codes were adopted in both chambers after limited debate and in the absence of the opposition. The Industrial Relations Code, the Social Security Code and the Code of Safety, Health and Working Conditions at Work, 2020, are an updated version of the respective codes of 2019, which have been reviewed by a standing committee. The root of the idea of ​​consolidated labor codes dates back to the June 2002 report of the Second National Labor Commission.

The broad vision has been to give a boost to economic activity without harming the interests of workers. Whether this is adequately reflected in the new provisions will be tested by the experience of the administration of the codes. A positive feature is that the Social Security Code promises the creation of social security funds for non-union workers, as well as for stage and platform workers, and also states that their welfare would be taken care of. by the National Social Security Council. A contentious article allows the competent government to exempt any new factory from all the provisions of the Code on health, safety and working conditions.

The threshold for considering any room as a factory has also been raised from 10 to 20 workers without the use of electricity and from 20 to 40 with electricity. It is significant that almost all the major unions oppose the new codes. There are many reasons to fear that granting wide discretion to central and state governments may not be in the interests of workers.

### SUMMARY

***THE HINDU EDITORIALS*** 🧐
> Salutary lesson: On the Vodafone case.
Vodafone Group Plc won the next round of its thirteen-year battle with the Indian tax authorities. On Friday, the International Arbitration Tribunal ruled that the Indian government's efforts to demand a tax of more than 20,000 rupees from Vodafone through retrospective legislation were clearly at odds with the protection of "fair and equal treatment" provided for in Article 4 of the India-Netherlands Bilateral Investment Treaty. The decision, which defended the position of a British multinational company, should put an end to India's lengthy and often perverted efforts to establish what was a very controversial claim at the outset.

Given that the share purchase transaction took place outside India between two overseas entities, Vodafone emphasized from the outset that it was not liable for any tax related to this transaction. Following the failure of the Bombay Supreme Court, Vodafone presented its position to the Supreme Court, which ruled in its favor in 2012. Add to this the considerable amount of money it owes to the government in terms of adjusted gross revenues and the future. industry is understandably Vodafone's vigilance to devote more capital to the Indian company. Any failure to learn from this loss should only weaken the confidence of foreign investors in India's commitment to international treaties and the rule of law.

The joint statement made by Sri Lanka and India following the virtual summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his counterpart Mahinda Rajapaksa on September 26 not only echoed India's declared policy of "equality, justice, peace and respect within a unified Sri Lanka". He spoke openly of the need for the Tamils to further the reconciliation process only through the implementation of the 13th Amendment of the Sri Lankan Constitution. Rajapaksa's later published office did not refer to the 13th Amendment, which stipulates power sharing with states based on the 1987 Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement. India's interest in this is undoubtedly the 13th Amendment, Sri Lanka, can heed the calls for the state council system to reclaim itself.

A strong man who, despite growing challenges, has tried to stay in power and a stubborn opposition determined to continue the protests despite police intervention, the political crisis in Belarus seems to have entered a dangerous stalemate. In the face of the toughest political crisis of his career, President Alexander Lukashenko shows no signs of compromise for a peaceful settlement of the crisis and a smooth transition of power. Earlier this month, he was secretly sworn in as his security police continued to crack down on the opposition. Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, the main opposition leader and challenger Lukashenko in the August 9 election, is in voluntary exile in neighboring Lithuania.

Maria Kolesnikova, another key figure in the opposition, is in custody. Lukashenko, who has been in power since 1994, won the presidential election with 80% of the vote, but the opposition says the vote has been rigged. they shed their weight for the opposition, while the annoyed Mr. Lukashenko turned to his most important ally, Russia's Vladimir Putin. Lukashenko has expressed a desire to withdraw Belarus from Moscow's orbit and strengthen economic and political ties with the West.

Lukashenko's plan is to continue to maintain power at all costs, which could call for international sanctions that would cause confusion in his economy. Lukashenko would find it difficult to gain legitimacy and stabilize his government. Lukashenko, sir.

> Justice in ruins: On Babri Masjid demolition case verdict.
Even when the Supreme Court handed over the empty space to those who wanted the mosque to be lowered to build a temple of Ram, recognizing the destruction as "a terrible violation of the rule of law" gave rise to hope that justice would end. He will be served with the punishment of those who mobilize the vandals. Throwing the Supreme Court's observations on the demolition to the winds, the court actually acquitted anyone accused of conspiracy to demolish the building and granted judicial legitimacy to the 'Ram Janmabhoomi movement'. The court found that the demolition was not pre-planned, that day more than a hundred thousand volunteers entered Ayodhya armed with crowbars, shovels, anchors and ropes, flying in front of all the tools needed to demolish a solid structure. clean the site.

Modified audio and video evidence, and even the possibility of rejections in recordings, will not undo the cumulative impact of logistics and financial preparation as well as social mobilization. This shows that the purpose of the mobilization exemplified by rath yatra is always to violently change the status quo. The Manmohan Singh Liberhan Commission had laid out the whole conspiracy in its damned report, but unfortunately, an investigation under the Investigation Commission Act has no binding value, whereas only the evidence added at the trial is significant. Of course, it is the CBI's responsibility to prove the conspiracy element, the details of the forward mobilization, the "meeting of minds" necessary to prove a conspiracy and its broad limits.

It's no surprise that the agency failed. Given the main events by the two FIRs, the United States government did not initially notify both of them when setting the courts for the trial. The Allahabad Supreme Court overturned the false notification and the State government's failure to correct the irregularity led to separate trials in Lucknow and Rae Bareilly. Instead of appealing to the State's refusal to treat a technical defect, the CBI filed an additional accusation form after skipping the 'conspiracy' charge.

The Supreme Court later said that this derailed the joint case and led to separate trials in two places. In 2017, the Supreme Court revitalized the conspiracy allegation, prompting the court to continue the daily trial, and reminded the institution sternly that this was due to its failure and that it was a crime that shook the secular fabric of the State government. The Constitution had not seen justice for 25 years. Whether a politically disrupted agency can successfully prosecute such a sensitive case is a controversial question. Anyone who has gone through this embarrassing period in India's political history knows that destruction is only the culmination of a vengeful movement.

This period was marked by mass mobilization, the holding of regiments to collect 'bricks' to build a temple, and an attempt to raid the area in 1990, and the result was bloodshed.

Nationally, however, the new infections added every day, to around 60,000, have been declining in recent days, according to data from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. The decision to allow states to consider reopening schools and coaching centers after Oct. 15, to students who wish to attend electively, will prove difficult, given new research data based on data from Tamil Nadu and the Andhra Pradesh indicating a high prevalence of infection among children who were contacts of virus cases in the same age group. Even in the face of a deadly pandemic,

During the monsoon and winter months, and during the holiday season, polite and persuasive application would be essential to reduce infection rates. Among the easing measures for the October unlocking phase is the authorization to open cinemas and multiplexes to 50% of their capacity, but the risk surrounding confined spaces and the transmission of asymptomatic individuals is real. Unfortunately, although it has focused on the massive cure rates of the infection, it has failed to standardize testing and reporting methods between states, and to publish detailed data on the types of tests performed in each state, anonymized patient history, post-recovery status for complications and mortality.

> The hole in the middle: On Physics Nobel.
Roger Penrose, now in Oxford and receiving half the prize, skillfully used mathematics in the 1960s to theorize under what conditions black holes should form. This was a time when the reality of black holes as a solution to Albert Einstein's General Theory of Relativity field equations was not accepted by many leading physicists. A few months after Einstein proposed the General Theory of Relativity in 1915, Karl Schwarzschild published a solution to field equations that exhibit singularities, or points where physical quantities grow or disappear infinitely. In this climate, observational clues of supermassive black holes came from the discovery of what were originally supermassive and called quasars at the center of galaxies.

The other half of the award is Reinhard Genzel in the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, Garching, Germany, and Prof. It was jointly given to Ghez. Sagittarius A * lies at the center of the Milky Way, about 26,000 light years away. Around this, all the stars orbiting the galaxy. In the 1990s, when telescopes and equipment were developed that could overcome this distance, Prof.

Genzel and Prof. Ghez formed independent groups to explore this area.

> Scissoring the DNA: On Chemistry Nobel.
Doudna recreated the bacteria's genetic scissors in a test tube and simplified the tool to make it easier to program the system to precisely cut specific areas of interest in any DNA, including humans. Gene editing technology has opened up a wide window of opportunity. Over the past six years, the tool has enabled scientists to organize human DNA in a dish, and early-stage clinical trials are attempting to use the tool to treat several diseases, including inherited disorders / diseases, and some types of cancer. Although in 2016 China launched the first human clinical trial to treat an aggressive lung cancer by introducing cells containing genes that have been edited using CRISPR-Cas9, the use of the tool has so far been limited to treating genetic diseases in animal models.

Last year, a Chinese researcher used this tool to alter a particular gene in the embryo to immunize babies against HIV infection, which sparked international outrage. Although no guidelines have been prepared so far, there is general consensus in the scientific and ethical community that the gene editing technique should not be used clinically in embryos. The gene editing tool has indeed "brought the life sciences into a new era."

### SUMMARY

***THE HINDU EDITORIALS*** 🧐
> The right balance: On Shaheen Bagh and the right to protest.
Long after Shaheen Bagh became a symbol of strong democratic resistance to a discriminatory law, the Supreme Court dared to conclude that such an ambiguous blockade of a public road was unacceptable. And that the administration should take action to eliminate the "rape and barriers" that arise during such protests. Protests, by their very nature, are not always based on legitimacy, but rather derive legitimacy from the justification of the underlying cause and the scope of public support. In this case, the Court rightly notes that the administration did not negotiate with the protesters in Shaheen Bagh and did not try to clear the scene.

Any finding that a peaceful protest has been going on for too long or is in a place deemed inappropriate to others should not encourage the administration to seek early limits on freedom of assembly. Such judicial certainty can undermine the greater democratic need for public expression of opposition in the most effective way and place.

> Show of unity: On AIADMK affairs.
By ending the rift over the Chief Ministerial candidate for the 2021 Tamil Nadu Assembly election, the leaders of the ruling AIADMK might have enthused the cadres, and also denied political rivals an opportunity to exploit the situation. In the absence of the party having a mass leader, both Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and his deputy in government, O. Panneerselvam, appear to have clearly understood their respective political limitations and made compromises. Panneerselvam, who had held the post of Chief Minister thrice for short tenures, has agreed to let Mr. Palaniswami be the party’s face in the election, perhaps realising that the latter has consolidated his hold among people who matter in the AIADMK. On his part, the Chief Minister shed his reluctance to constitute an 11-member steering committee, a long-pending key demand of Mr. Panneerselvam, to avert any rebellion from him, irrespective of its political impact.

Palaniswami, who has six nominees, all cabinet ministers. Panneerselvam could be put to the test during the distribution of the party ticket to AIADMK aspirants. Electorally, the impact of the ruling party’s latest decisions will depend upon multiple factors including a possible realignment of political forces and actor Rajinikanth launching his proposed party. Besides, a further churning within the AIADMK cannot be ruled out if V. .

### SUMMARY

***THE HINDU EDITORIALS*** 🧐
> Food for peace: On 2020 Peace Nobel.
This year’s prize has been awarded to the World Food Programme , of the UN system, for its contribution to combating hunger in conflict and disaster-struck sites. The Norwegian Nobel Committee took note of the WFP’s life-saving role in the year of the pandemic, staving off catastrophes of hunger in Yemen, Congo, Nigeria, South Sudan and Burkina Faso. The Prize is a fitting tribute to the aid workers who brave hazardous conditions to reach starving people in theatres of war, civil strife and natural disasters, moving food on aircraft, trucks and even all-terrain amphibious vehicles. The decision to honour the WFP echoes the advice of another peace laureate from 1949, Lord John Boyd Orr, the first head of the FAO, that peace cannot be built on empty stomachs.

Clearly, without stronger commitment from the big powers, the challenge to feed the millions who suffer acute hunger due to conflict and failed agriculture can never be met. This is a time for the world’s big powers to strengthen the UN system, espousing fraternity, shunning militarism, greening economies and resolving conflicts in the true spirit of the Peace Prize.

### SUMMARY

***THE HINDU EDITORIALS*** 🧐
> Feat of clay: On French Open tennis championship 2020.
The 2020 French Open was unlike any previous edition of the Major. The straight sets demolition of World No. 1 Novak Djokovic, his toughest rival, brought the Spaniard level with Roger Federer’s men’s record for Grand Slam titles and has set up a mouth-watering 2021. But Nadal’s preparation for the tournament was far from ideal.

Djokovic’s role in this is central. After the nearly six-hour long Australian Open final defeat to Djokovic in 2012, Nadal spruced up his attacking play. Since the return from the 2015-16 slump, he continuously worked to better his backhand and break out of the losing patterns Djokovic drew him into. While Nadal led Djokovic by just one point in rallies lasting five shots or more , he crushed the Serb 53-25 in those that had four shots or less.

Where Nadal made just nine backhand errors, he drew 26 more from Djokovic’s favoured wing. The Pole felled the tactically astute Sofia Kenin with a ruthless display of power and intelligence to claim her maiden Major without losing a set. The French Open has crowned four straight first-time women’s Grand Slam champions, rewarding styles ranging from all-out attack to nimble-footed craftiness.

The protesters have earned the support of sections of society. The declaration of the emergency decree comes a day after protesters raised the three-finger salute, a symbol of resistance taken from The Hunger Games trilogy, at a royal motorcade. Now, the protesters are openly challenging the powers of King Vajiralongkorn, who ascended the throne in 2016 after the death of his father, Bhumibol Adulyadej. Prayuth, have become symbols of extravagance and oppression for the protesters, who have dismissed the emergency decree, saying the movement has gone past the point of no-return, and in turn setting the stage for a showdown with the police.

In 1976, the police and right-wing thugs massacred protesters in Thammasat University, Bangkok.

### SUMMARY

***THE HINDU EDITORIALS*** 🧐
> Crisis in Caucasus: On Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh.
In 1988, when the Soviet power was receding, the regional assembly in Nagorno-Karabakh voted to join Armenia, triggering ethnic clashes. After the Soviet disintegration in 1991, Armenia and Azerbaijan went to war over this largely mountainous, forested enclave. By the time a ceasefire was reached in 1994, the rebels, with support from Armenia and Russia, had established their de facto rule and extended their influence to the Armenian border.
Russia enjoys good economic and defence ties with both Armenia and Azerbaijan. But Armenia, as a CSTO member and host to a Russian military base, has more weight. In a wider conflict, Armenia could trigger Article 4 of the CSTO treaty and ask for Russian help. And if Moscow responds favourably, that would pit Russia against Turkey, a NATO member.

Russia, already involved in military conflicts in Syria, Ukraine and Libya, may not like opening another front. Instead of risking a regional war, Azerbaijan, Armenia and the Karabakh rebels should go back to the ceasefire and open up diplomatic channels.

### SUMMARY

***THE HINDU EDITORIALS*** 🧐
> Dealing with a deluge: On Hyderabad floods.
A deep monsoon depression over the west central Bay of Bengal, which weakened as it moved over Telangana, resulted in downpours over several districts in the State, severely affecting the city of Hyderabad as well. On October 13, the monthly average rainfall of Hyderabad for October was surpassed on a single day when 192 mm of rain fell. Such a high intensity downpour in a short span is bound to affect a densely populated urban area, and Hyderabad was no exception. At least 24 people were killed and several localities submerged and isolated following incessant rains and the overflowing of the city’s lakes.

Construction over lake beds and encroachments of drainage channels have been identified as problems that have exacerbated flooding and inundation in the city in the past . But the little that has been done to unblock existing storm drains over the last decade has not been enough to handle the requirements of the city, which still depends upon an antiquated sewerage and drainage system. Hyderabad urgently needs to expand and remodel its drainage system. An analysis by the Centre for Science and Environment in 2016 revealed that 3,245 hectares of water bodies were lost in Hyderabad between 1989 and 2001.

In the long term, the effects of flooding due to deluges can only be mitigated if urban planners take into account the hydro-geology of cities and ensure that construction, development and land occupation do not take place in a way that reduces the area of wetlands.

> Hope amid uncertainty: On IMF’s World Economic Outlook.
With COVID-19 having already extracted a toll of over a million lives, accompanied by an evisceration of livelihoods and output in economies, prognosticating the economic future even as the pandemic rages on is an unenviable task. The Fund’s economists have gamely sought to make forecasts for world output through 2020, 2021 and into the medium term. While the global economy is projected to shrink 4.4% this year, reflecting a less severe contraction than the 5.2% drop estimated in June, output is seen rebounding at a marginally slower 5.2% pace in 2021. Pointing out that the pandemic is set to leave scars well into the medium term ‘as labour markets take time to heal, investment is held back by uncertainty and balance sheet problems, and lost schooling impairs human capital’, IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath contends that global growth will gradually slow to about 3.5% in the medium term.

With the cumulative loss in output relative to the pre-pandemic projected path estimated to more than double to $28 trillion over 2020–25, efforts to improve average living standards are certain to be severely set back. Observing that the pandemic is set to widen inequality between economies and within nations, the Fund has urged greater international cooperation. It is imperative for all countries to work closely to ensure that new treatments and vaccines are made available to all since wider and faster availability of medical solutions could boost global income by almost $9 trillion by end-2025, reducing income divergence, she says.

### SUMMARY

***THE HINDU EDITORIALS*** 🧐
> The NEET challenge: On conducting of NEET exams.
The results were declared last week, and the top score was a perfect 720, scored not by one, but two students, who will have their choice of college in the undergraduate medical programme. The decision to conduct the exam, when there was uncertainty about the ability of students to reach the centres, was probably bold, though it had not factored in the lowest common denominator. Students in certain circumstances, , and in certain boards of education will remain at a disadvantage, as a result of this. Even as scores show an overall improvement over the years, States must not rest in their endeavour to ease the access to, and enhance students’ ability to clear the test successfully, even without the need to spend much on coaching classes.

Certain measures, including Tamil Nadu’s move to reserve 7.5% of MBBS seats for State government school students who clear NEET, running State-sponsored, free or heavily subsidised coaching programmes, and a reassessment of the regional State syllabus, will all enable a more equitable scenario. If coaching can help bridge the yawning gap, then the State could mandate that private coaching centres do not charge exorbitantly for conducting year-long coaching programmes and even provide reasonable subsidies for certain groups of students.

### SUMMARY

***THE HINDU EDITORIALS*** 🧐
> A tool for thought: On coronavirus pandemic in India.
A committee of experts — well-regarded mathematicians and infectious disease experts — appointed by the Department of Science and Technology to use mathematical modelling and forecast the course of the pandemic has brought good tidings. By their estimate, India passed its COVID-19 peak in September and the decline in the overall caseload being observed for nearly a month now is to continue. The decline will continue only if there are no major mutations during winter, protective antibodies are durable, and current restrictions are maintained. There would be no significant gains from a strict lockdown beyond the district level, and current containment measures would suffice, except if there are local outbreaks that threaten to overwhelm health-care facilities there. Their calculation also showed a peak by July latest, with anything from six to 15 times the existing infections had there been no lockdown or if it had been delayed to April.
The datasets it has relied on are publicly available and the modelling employs a category of models called SEIR that estimates, within a population, those Susceptible, Exposed, Infected and Recovered. It is extremely dependent on the quality of data that is used as an input and relies as much on simplifying assumptions that sacrifice complexity for comprehension but there is nothing to suggest, from what is known about the exercise, that it is more likely to be true than similar estimates from scores of models the world over that subscribe to a certain degree of rigour.
