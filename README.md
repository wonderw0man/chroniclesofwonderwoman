> A Golden Moment: On India's win in Chess Olympiad.

~By~ winning the joint championship with RUSSIA in online chess olympiad held on Sunday ~beacuse~ of the 44th edition had to be postponed till next year due to the pandemic, INDIA proves that it is growing its stature in the world of chess.The victroy was shared because The Indian team management lodged a complaint, and the FIDE proposed its decision for sharing the championship on which Russia  agreed, beacuse the 2nd round of final was affected by a net outage, due to this India’s Nihal Sarin and Divya Deshmukh had lost on time. ~Thus~, there was a fruitful ending to the final. When Armenians raised similar complaint after the loss of game, to India in the first match of the quarter-final. They protested by not playing the second match and withdrew from the competition. But that incident should not take the sheen off India’s triumph. 
 
 ~If~ Viswanathan Anand and Koneru Humpy are among the greatest players the world has ever seen, Nihal and R. Praggnanandhaa could be tomorrow’s stars. In the euphoria surrounding the great Indian victory, some grim facts should not be overlooked. The Indian chess team pulled off a thrilling victory against Poland in the semifinal of the Olympiad when the Arjuna awards were being distributed by President Ram Nath Kovind online on Saturday. Ironically, no chess player has won an Arjuna for seven years. India captain Vidit Gujrathi had said how the team was on its own ahead of the Olympiad with no support from the All India Chess Federation. The chief selector R.B. Ramesh  quit because he was forced to announce two separate teams for the Olympiad. This moment of glory, therefore, is also a time for introspection.

> Grim Sovereign Tangle: On GST compensation standoff.

All of the profits gained by implmentation of GST have quickly unravelled because the slowdown in the economy, and worsen by COVID-19 lockdowns, has thrown all revenue calculations to the wind. The Centre is obliged to pay to the States, for a duration of 5 years, compensation for revenue shortfalls in return for their having ceded the strength to levy the a multiple of taxes that have been absorbed into the GST. Last week, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman asserted, that the Centre will not be able to meet the compensation shortfall. With GST collections sharply undershooting all targets this year, the Center estimates compensation payable for the full year at ₹3-lakh crore. But just ₹65,000 crore is expected in the cess kitty used to pay out the compensation.
 
In July, the Centre paid out the last instalment of fiscal for the economy and is, so far, yet to pay anything for this year. The Centre contends that only ₹97,000 crore of the revenue shortfall is from implementation of the GST, while ₹1.38-lakh crore is due to remarkable occasions posed by an ‘Act of God’(the pandemic). States can both borrow ₹97,000 crore, without having it added to their debt and with the principal and interest paid out from future cess collections, or they can borrow the entire ₹2.35-lakh crore shortfall, but will must offer for interest payments themselves. Several States have rejected both options and some, including Tamil Nadu, have urged the Center to rethink in view of their essential and urgent spending needs to curb the pandemic and spur growth.

> Loyalty test: On Congress and reform.

Far from living up to that claim, Rahul Gandhi led the coterie in questioning the timing and intent of the reformists who did little more than echo his own views about the party’s problems. No one, least of all well-wishers of the Congress party, would find it difficult to disagree with the issues raised by the party leaders such as the erosion of the party base, particularly among the youth, a drift caused by the absence of a full-time president, the dismantling of all forums for discussions in the party, concentration of power, and the disuse of the merit-cum-consensus method of appointments within the party. While the Congress is crumbling, the BJP is advancing its contentious agenda, these leaders pointed out. The notion of a conflict between loyalists and dissenters is being peddled by a gang of self-serving leaders to explain the churn in the Congress.

Those who may not play the obsequious roles conventionally scripted for a Congress leader are Mr. Gandhi’s greatest allies if he were to push for the party’s revival. It is possible that reformists also have a career agenda, but that is no sin in politics.

> Appropriate strategy: On India banning more China apps.

The blocking of a more than hundreds of Chinese mobile applications suggests that the Indian government, wants to make it clear that it will not shy away from leveraging its position as a massive market for technology in dealing with potentially dangerous geopolitical issues.
Since June, the government has till now stepped in thrice to block many Chinese applications in one go, including the latest decision on Wednesday where 118 apps were blocked in respect "prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of State and public order".  Over 200 Chinese apps, which were accessed by millions of Indian users, have been blocked in all till date.

It could be argued that loss of access to the Indian market will sharply affect the ambitions of the Internet giants emerging from China, but it remains to be seen if this tech-side intervention is effective as a counter in a geopolitical fight. Instead, the Indian response to complaints has been to straight away block these apps all together.

> The right keys: On Unlock 4.

The Unlock 4 guidelines of the Home Ministry allowing all but a few activities that attract large crowds, with supportive measures by States, reflect deep economic distress. This comes at a time when daily infections are scaling new highs — 78,512 on Monday — and growing at a rate faster than in the U.S. and Brazil, which have held the top spots globally. When the pandemic was unfolding, a major concern was that of a wildfire spread overwhelming a lopsided health-care system, in which intensive care is meager, urban-centric and expensive even for the middle class. This painful reality, of the virus retaining high transmissible and unpredictable disease impacts, is as relevant today as it was then, as people resume their jobs and travel.

> Deal in danger: On post-Brexit U.K.-EU trade deal.

The agreement had sought to avoid a hard border coming up between Northern Ireland, which is part of the U. The hard Brexiteers in Mr. Johnson’s Conservative Party were critical of this clause, claiming that it endangers the U. laws rather than the divorce agreement. Northern Ireland leaders have already called it a «betrayal». The real risk of cutting the region off the EU customs code is that physical checks could emerge between the two Irelands, threatening the Good Friday agreement that brought peace. With weeks to go before the deadline, there is still no consensus on issues such as workers’ rights, environmental regulations, state aid to businesses and the Irish border.

to adopt rules that are close to its own to ensure a «level playing field» in trade, the British government argues that the whole point of the EU divorce was to break free from common rules. Regarding Northern Ireland, the hard Brexiteers are opposed to any special treatment to the region. The new legislation suggests that the government is hardening its position on Ireland as well. Driven by English nationalist fervour, the British leadership appears to be blind to the economic and political consequences of its hard line.

The Brexiteers have already pushed the U. A no-deal exit will inflict severe economic costs on the British, at a time when the economy is in dire straits due to COVID-19. Besides, it risks disrupting peace in the island of Ireland. They should instead respect the withdrawal agreement, and be flexible in the talks as well as on deadlines.

### SUMMARY

***THE HINDU EDITORIALS*** 🧐

Test by choice: On rising coronavirus cases in India.

> On September 4, India crossed four million novel coronavirus cases, 13 days after crossing three million on August 22. On Sunday, India surpassed Brazil to record the second highest number of cases in the world. Though the number of tests done each day has been over one million for the past week, the test positivity rate nationally is still high at 7.7%, indicating that testing has to be ramped up. Though the testing done each day by many States has been growing, nearly 50% of them are rapid antigen, of only about 50-60% sensitivity.

Unfortunately, with no repeat testing of negative cases and only a small percentage of people with symptoms but negative results being validated with a RT-PCR, many of the infected are not being diagnosed. The ICMR’s latest advisory provides for testing on demand to «ensure higher levels of testing». With States not validating the negative results from rapid antigen tests with RT-PCR, non-directed tests on demand might help more in increasing the number of tests done each day and hence in reducing the test positivity rate than in early detection and containment. Since many of those infected have mild or no symptoms, tests on demand might be particularly helpful in detecting cases that might otherwise have been missed.

Else, States might be forced to use their discretionary power to deny tests for people not exhibiting symptoms or in low-risk categories, or selectively charge for testing to pay for procurement of testing kits and to avoid more pressure on the testing infrastructure. There is also the possibility of an over-reliance on antigen testing to cope with the growing demand for testing.

Vaccine for all: On COVID-19 vaccine policy.

> In the initial stages, global health leaders have been advancing the vaccine for essential workers and those at risk including senior citizens and those with co-morbidities. Tedros said, «some people in all countries, rather than all people in some countries», should have access to the vaccine in the early phase. Even in this initial stage, the government should make the vaccine available free of cost to those who cannot pay, or at affordable rates. As production kicks off, initial production costs are likely to be high, even astronomical, and it is the duty of governments to cushion the cost.

Leaving gaps in the delivery of the vaccine will only serve to allow the virus to survive, and continue to wreak further damage. India has a fairly reliable vaccine delivery system for children, as part of the universal immunisation programme. All people in the country must have access to the vaccine, and, if necessary, periodic doses of it. Indeed, the mobilisation for this task in India should be nothing short of heroic, as and when the vaccine is available here.

This includes taking sensitive, but firm, decisions guided by evidence, on who will receive the vaccine, how, when and where. Putting down a standard operating protocol for every stage of the vaccine will serve the government well when the baton is finally passed on to it.

Digital disconnect: On online learning and digital divide.

> The digital chasm that separates the privileged from the deprived remains unbridged years after the broadband policy of 2004, and its effects are painfully evident during the pandemic as students struggle to log on to online classes. Only in Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala did the survey find Internet access exceeding 50% for urban and rural households taken together, while Punjab, Haryana and Uttarakhand exceeded 40%, unimpressive numbers still. If net connectivity is 5% to 10% in rural Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and West Bengal, only a slim minority can hope to do any academic work. Prime Minister Modi has acknowledged the digital divide by announcing in his Independence Day address that all villages would be connected with optical fibre cable in 1,000 days.

Mapping the needs of each district based on the NSO data will help identify areas where children do need equipment and connectivity. The government needs to look at all possibilities and go into overdrive to bridge the digital divide.

***THE HINDU EDITORIALS*** 🧐

> Something rotten: On Sushant Singh Rajput death and the media mob.

A young talented Bollywood actor tragically ended his life on June 14. But the events that followed Sushant Singh Rajput’s death by suicide have been even more shocking. A section of the media pounced on Rhea, terming her a gold digger, and handed out instant verdicts in the newsroom. That Sushant hailed from poll-bound Bihar added a political dimension impossible to ignore.

The actor, reported to have been suffering from depression, lived in Mumbai, which is now ruled by estranged Bharatiya Janata Party partner, the Shiv Sena, together with the Nationalist Congress Party and Congress, and his demise has become political fodder crossing limits of decency, drawing in other Bollywood celebrities.

Whether Rhea has committed a crime the law will decide, but as she and her family fight this battle, the spotlight is firmly on Indian society and its deeply entrenched prejudices. Women’s rights activists have spoken up against the demonisation of Rhea, and how gender, the clothes she wore, the undefined relationship she had with the actor, all played a role. What is perhaps more disturbing is that many women, far from empathizing with a girl who lost her boyfriend in such circumstances, have been quick to pronounce Rhea guilty of any number of wrongdoings.

> Glimmer of hope: On India-China five-point consensus.
India and China have taken the first step to begin real disengagement at the border

The "five-point consensus" reached by the Foreign Ministers of India and China in Moscow on Thursday provides a glimmer of hope of a diplomatic solution, while thousands of troops from both countries remain deployed along the border. At the same time, stark differences remain, including on the key question of whether both sides will return to the status quo ante prior to China’s transgressions. India stressed that peace on the boundary was essential for ties, and that recent incidents had impacted the broader relationship. This characterisation of India’s stand was a sharp contrast from Delhi’s recent public statements, which have emphasised border peace as a prerequisite to taking forward the broader relationship.

Moreover, a day before the talks, China’s official news agency issued a commentary placing the onus entirely on India to defuse tensions, accusing India of «reckless provocations», telling India «to learn from history», and reiterating that China «will not lose an inch of territory». It is welcome that India and China have finally found something to agree on. The continuing rounds of talks should be aimed sincerely at disengagement, and not at presenting a veneer of diplomatic engagement even while China strengthens its hold along the LAC. India will need to verify before it can trust each of China’s steps from now on.

### SUMMARY

***THE HINDU EDITORIALS*** 🧐
> Pushback: On U.S. revoking visa to Chinese students.
The Trump administration has revoked visas for more than 1,000 Chinese citizens, mainly students and researchers, deemed to be risks to national security owing to their alleged connections to Chinese military establishments and concern over industrial espionage. The White House’s latest policy action has been housed under Mr. Trump’s May 29 announcement responding to China’s curbs on democracy in Hong Kong. Among the reasons stated was the intention to block the entry of persons associated with slave labour, thought to be a reference to alleged rights violations of China’s Uighur Muslims. This visa policy comes after measures that have tightened the screws on the U. immigration system, including halting the issuance of green cards and skilled worker visas and challenging the issuance of student visas for college programmes that have migrated entirely to online mode due to the pandemic.

However, in the prior cases of visa issuance bans, the nationals of a single country were not targeted in the way that Chinese citizens have been under this week’s visa revocation. The deeper context of this spat is the cycle of hostile tit-for-tat exchanges between Washington and Beijing, principally tariff wars in the realm of trade, but extending to human rights and China’s COVID-19 response. On the one hand the Trump administration might have overreached in this broad-brush policy, perhaps sweeping up innocent researchers with no more than nominal association with a government-affiliated academic entity in China. Either way, China’s economic aggression will continue to face pushback from a wounded and angry America.

> Long haul ahead: On demand-supportive fiscal policies.
The most telltale sign of this flattening is the more than halved pace of growth in the solitary use-based industrial activity of the IIP’s six product groups, in which output had turned positive in June. The other five groups posted double-digit contractions, with consumer durables and capital goods shrinking 23.6% and 22.8%, respectively. If the trend in durables attests to the RBI’s evaluation last month that «private consumption has lost its discretionary elements across the board», the capital goods data point to a dismal picture on the investment front. A deeper look at the 23 subcategories of manufacturing shows that only tobacco products and pharmaceuticals posted expansions in July, with the latter benefitting from the increased global demand for medicines, including generic drugs, in the wake of the pandemic.

The manufacture of pharmaceuticals, medicinal chemical and botanical products climbed 22% in July, making it the solitary product to post an expansion of 1.8% over April-July.

### SUMMARY

***THE HINDU EDITORIALS*** 🧐
> More at the top: on US Open 2020.
The 2020 US Open, which concluded at New York on Sunday, may not have had its usual star dust, but that should not deflect from the excellence of Dominic Thiem and Naomi Osaka, who won their first and third Grand Slam singles titles, respectively. 1 Novak Djokovic, chasing Federer’s all-time record of 20 Grand Slams, took the bait, only to be disqualified in the fourth round for accidentally striking a line judge with the ball. Statistics aside, the tournament provided the first glimpse of how men’s tennis could shape up in the absence of Federer, Djokovic and Nadal. The Thiem-led mid-card, which also includes Zverev, Daniil Medvedev and Stefanos Tsitsipas, made good on its promise and provided three of the four semifinalists.

The most recent was in Melbourne early this year, where he came within a set of defeating Djokovic in the final after having already felled the then World No. The Japanese is the most decorated Asian singles player and her use of the platform of being the most marketable sportswoman on the planet to highlight instances of racial injustice has captured the world’s imagination. Serena, who failed yet again in her quest to capture a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam, will remain the top draw as long as she plays. But Osaka has carved out her own identity.

The immediate future of tennis may lie in a sequestered world of bio-secure bubbles, but barriers are no doubt being taken down.

> Venus in focus.
Earth's "sister planet" - Venus, the hottest planet in the solar system with surface temperature above 460 degree celcius, the planet was considered hostile to life.
Earlier there was a signs of ozone found by the European Space Agency in their mission Venus Express. Now in the recent discovery of traces of phosphine in its atmosphere has given a reason to search for extraterrestrial life. Through extraordinary chemistry and thermodynamics of the biology and life states the fact that when hostile conditions are added on Venus's surface, lure possiblities of phosphine's survival.

Prof. Jane S. Greaves of Cardiff University first identified phosphine in Venus's atmosphere in 2017, using the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope in Hawaii. The suspicions of research was confirmed in 2019, by further study and precise observations using the Atacama Large mm / sub-mm Array facility in Chile.

The presence of sulphuric acid in the atmoshphere of Venus makes it highly corrosive. Pherpas flying at a height and sending down the drones and ballons are more feasible than landing. NASA's mission is covered for launch next year, while ISRO is looking at 2023 rightnow.
Large number of collaborations may well improve chances of efficiently searching the dense atmosphere of the sister planet.

> New order in West Asia: On Abraham Accords.
Under the agreement, the UAE and Bahrain would normalise ties with Israel, heralding better economic, political and security engagement. More Arab countries are expected to follow suit, say U. The agreements have the backing of Saudi Arabia, arguably the most influential Arab power and a close ally of the UAE and Bahrain. The ailing, octogenarian ruler of the Kingdom, Salman bin Abdulaziz, is treading cautiously for now, but Riyadh has opened its airspace for commercial flights between the UAE and Israel. The accords, the first between Israel and Arab countries since the 1994 Jordan-Israel peace treaty, also offer a rare diplomatic win to Mr. With less than 50 days to go before his re-election bid, he has called the agreements «the new dawn of a new Middle East».

Though of historical and geopolitical significance, it is too early to say whether the accords will have any meaningful impact on West Asia’s myriad conflicts. Unlike Egypt and Jordan, which signed peace treaties with Israel in 1979 and 1994, respectively, the Gulf countries are not frontline states in the Arab-Israeli conflict. Second, the agreements leave the Palestinian question largely unaddressed. With Arab countries signing diplomatic agreements with Israel bilaterally, the Arab collective support for the Palestinian movement for nationhood, which has been the basis of the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative, is crumbling.

But it does not mean that the Palestinian question would fade away. Three, the UAE-Bahrain agreements are in fact endorsing the region’s emerging order.

> Need for caution: On Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine.
The Russian Direct Investment Fund , which is piloting the Sputnik V vaccine, has announced a partnership with the Hyderabad-based Dr. Sputnik V is being developed as a two-dose vaccine on a human adenovirus vaccine platform. Several vaccines that are in development are also being deployed on similar platforms, and the evidence so far is that none of these has been commercially approved for use in humans though there is an experimental vaccine for Ebola. Results of the Phase-1 and Phase-2 trials of the vaccine, published in The Lancet, suggest that the evidence so far is that it has proven safe and efficacious enough to progress to the next stage of trials. There is immense political pressure globally on regulatory agencies to get a vaccine out at the earliest.

The Serum Institute has committed to producing 100 million doses of its vaccine for India and other ‘Low and Middle Income Countries’ at less than $3 per dose. Reportedly, half of these are for India. All in all, there seems to be a guarantee for only about 150 million doses for India, which given the country’s population is minuscule.

> Continuity in change: On Japan’s new Prime Minister.
Less than a month after his sudden announcement that he would step down due to health reasons, Japan’s longest serving Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, 65, has passed on the baton to his long-term associate, Yoshihide Suga, 71. Suga promises continuity rather than change as he takes the reins. Suga was Minister of State for Internal Affairs and Communications during Mr. Suga said his goal is to continue with Mr. His close personal relationship with Mr. Modi, both seen as «strongmen» leaders, built on his earlier partnership with former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom he shared his famous «three arrows» economic strategy called ‘Abenomics’. Suga would be well aware of the big shoes he must fill and the importance of the relationship with India for Japan.

It is significant that one of the new government’s first engagements is likely to be the Foreign Minister-level meeting of the Quad countries in Tokyo next month, which will also give New Delhi insight into how much has changed and how much will stay the same in Japan’s view of the world with the change at the helm.

### SUMMARY

***THE HINDU EDITORIALS*** 🧐
> Market failure: On agriculture sector reforms.
Several States have already liberalized agricultural marketing, amending their APMC Acts, and some have allowed regulated private commerce including direct marketing. Yet, provisions in the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce Bill, 2020, providing for unfettered commerce in designated trade areas outside APMC jurisdictions without levy of any fee, and more generally, empowering the Centre to issue orders to States in furtherance of the law’s objectives, have alarmed States. A challenge has been mounted by Rajasthan, declaring central warehouses as procurement centres under its APMC Act, and therefore required to pay a market fee to the State. When Bihar removed the APMC system, markets suffered loss of fee revenue, with no significant private investments in the sector.

If the Centre’s intent is to strengthen competition, it should massively fund the expansion of the APMC market system, removing trade cartels, and providing farmers good roads, logistics of scale and real time information. Rather than opt for heavy centralisation, the emphasis should be on empowering farmers through State Farmers Commissions recommended by the NCF, to bring about a speedy government response to issues. Without strong institutional arrangements, laissez-faire policy may harm lakhs of unorganised small farmers, who have been remarkably productive and shored up the economy even during a pandemic.

### SUMMARY

***THE HINDU EDITORIALS*** 🧐
> Cricket in action: On IPL 2020.
The Twenty20 tournament seemingly brooked no resistance while the purists leant on the classical air that permeated Test cricket. Even in 2009 and 2014 when the Lok Sabha elections clashed with the IPL’s schedule, the Board of Control for Cricket in India solved the logistical nightmare. Because of the constraints imposed by the virus and the cancellation of domestic cricket in India for now, the IPL at the Emirates, has turned out to be the season opener for the national players while also offering an opportunity for overseas stars to have a biff in the park. The players have to watch their health-parameters while helping cricket find its feet, an endeavour that England did first with remarkable efficiency by hosting the West Indies, Pakistan and Australia.

Cricket in the Indian context has made a start and a lot is at stake as this IPL also offers a stage for Kohli and company to prepare for the coming tour of Australia.
