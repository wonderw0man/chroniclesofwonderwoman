> A Golden Moment: On India's win in Chess Olympiad

~By~ winning the joint championship with RUSSIA in online chess olympiad held on Sunday ~beacuse~ of the 44th edition had to be postponed till next year due to the pandemic, INDIA proves that it is growing its stature in the world of chess.The victroy was shared because The Indian team management lodged a complaint, and the FIDE proposed its decision for sharing the championship on which Russia  agreed, beacuse the 2nd round of final was affected by a net outage, due to this India’s Nihal Sarin and Divya Deshmukh had lost on time. ~Thus~, there was a fruitful ending to the final. When Armenians raised similar complaint after the loss of game, to India in the first match of the quarter-final. They protested by not playing the second match and withdrew from the competition. But that incident should not take the sheen off India’s triumph. 
 
 ~If~ Viswanathan Anand and Koneru Humpy are among the greatest players the world has ever seen, Nihal and R. Praggnanandhaa could be tomorrow’s stars. In the euphoria surrounding the great Indian victory, some grim facts should not be overlooked. The Indian chess team pulled off a thrilling victory against Poland in the semifinal of the Olympiad when the Arjuna awards were being distributed by President Ram Nath Kovind online on Saturday. Ironically, no chess player has won an Arjuna for seven years. India captain Vidit Gujrathi had said how the team was on its own ahead of the Olympiad with no support from the All India Chess Federation. The chief selector R.B. Ramesh  quit because he was forced to announce two separate teams for the Olympiad. This moment of glory, therefore, is also a time for introspection.

> Grim Sovereign Tangle: On GST compensation standoff

All of these profits have quickly unravelled because the slowdown in the economy, worsen by COVID-19 lockdowns, has thrown all revenue calculations to the wind. The Centre is obliged to pay to the States, for a duration of 5 years, compensation for revenue shortfalls in return for their having ceded the strength to levy the a multiple of taxes that have been absorbed into the GST. Last week, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman asserted, at what may have been the most negligible GST Council meeting so far, that the Centre will not be able to meet the compensation shortfall. With GST collections sharply undershooting all targets this year, the Center estimates compensation payable for the full year at ₹3-lakh crore. But just ₹65,000 crore is expected in the cess kitty used to pay out the compensation.
 
In July, the Centre paid out the last instalment of compensation for the ultimate economic and is, so far, yet to pay anything for this year. The Centre contends that only ₹97,000 crore of the revenue shortfall is from implementation of the GST, while ₹1.38-lakh crore is due to remarkable occasions posed by an ‘Act of God’ . States can both borrow ₹97,000 crore, without having it added to their debt and with the principal and interest paid out from future cess collections, or they can borrow the entire ₹2.35-lakh crore shortfall, but will must offer for interest payments themselves. Several States have rejected both options and some, including Tamil Nadu, have urged the Center to rethink in view of their essential and urgent spending needs to curb the pandemic and spur growth.
